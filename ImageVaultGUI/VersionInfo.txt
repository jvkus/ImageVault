// In progress
Needs:
Save As: needs to have a proper selection box for selecting output file types. Jpeg should be blocked.

Scaling for image needs to be replaced, the current image does not scale correctly.

Save: needs to be modified so it does not replace the input file. Should only be allowed with new output file. 


Could add:
Better output box for text data.

Better encoding scheme.

Pop up box prompting save when encoding complete.

Better progress bar.
